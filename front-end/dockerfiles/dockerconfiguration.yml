#Main reason for extracting it is allowing for a dynamic run of an application container
#while also mantaining security and only allowing whats inside this file to be executed with checks
#for common exploits and ways of obtaining information
#if it starts with $ it will be transfered from container machine
#iff that application is allowed to access those specific details
#else anyone could create a simple app that asks for them and prints the value
